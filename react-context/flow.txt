Create a file in the root of your react-context solution directory named flow.txt. For each feature in the application, describe the flow of the code in writing, including the client, server, and database. How does the code work?

User can sign up.
1. user entered data is stored in state of AuthForm component
2. this data is then sent to server by handleSubmit
3. server queries database to insert new user record into user table

User can sign in.
1. password and username stored in state of AuthForm after entered by user
2. data sent to server by handleSubmit
3. response from server contains a token
4. this.props.onSignin called on response from server
5. handleSignIn/onSignIn saves token to local storage at 'react-context-jwt'
and stores user information in the state of the App compponent.
6. user information made available to other components through context


User can stay signed in (even if they refresh the page).
1. at componentDidMount of App, localStorage is checked for a token. If
there is a token, it is decoded to get user information. User information
 then passed to rest of component tree through context


User can sign out.
1. when handleSignOut is called, user data is removed from localStorage and state.user of
App component is set to null. All the components further down the component tree know about
the change in state.user because they are subscribed to it through context
